## A Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence of 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8....
## The first two terms are 0 and 1. All other terms are obtained by adding the preceding two terms. This means to say the nth term is the sum of (n-1)th and (n-2)th term

# Program to display the Fibonacci sequence up to n-th term

nterms = int(input("How many terms? "))

# first two terms
n1, n2 = 0, 1
count = 0

# check if the number of terms is valid
if nterms <= 0:
   print("Please enter a positive integer")
# if there is only one term, return n1
elif nterms == 1:
   print("Fibonacci sequence upto",nterms,":")
   print(n1)
# generate fibonacci sequence
else:
   print("Fibonacci sequence:")
   while count < nterms:
       print(n1)
       nth = n1 + n2
       # update values
       n1 = n2
       n2 = nth
       count += 1
Run Code
Output

How many terms? 7
Fibonacci sequence:
0
1
1
2
3
5
8

## Approach 2
def fibonacci(n):
    a,b=0,1
    print(a)
    while (b<n):
        print(b)
        c=a+b
        a=b
        b=c
## Approach 3 using recursion
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
 
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 9
    print(fibonacci(n))
